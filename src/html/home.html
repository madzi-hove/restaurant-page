        Serving up classic homestyle food in a retro-style dining room, this old-school restaurant is worthy of your
        attention for a variety of reasons. We offer great food and great service! Home-style foods just like Mom used
        to make. All of our sauces, gravys, mashed
        potatoes, carrot salad and dishes are home-made
